"""
core/dream.py
Schedules Aiko's nightly dream() consolidation pass at 00:00 local time.

Usage — call start() once during Aiko startup (e.g. in UI):
    from core.dream import start as start_dream_scheduler
    start_dream_scheduler(memorize_instance)

The scheduler runs in a background daemon thread and fires dream() at midnight.
It does NOT block startup or conversation flow.

VRAM safety:
    dream() does zero LLM calls — only Qdrant vector ops and mem0 deletes.
    No Ollama contention. Safe to fire even if a conversation is mid-flight,
    though a _dream_lock flag is checked to avoid overlapping passes.
